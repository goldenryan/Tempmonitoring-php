This is the temperature monitoring website written in php with a python script taking information from an old monitoring device in our server room.  Christian Mesh and I had written this website to show the temperature in our server room over long periods of time and alert all Clarkson Open Source Institute Administrators when the temperature got dangerously high.  We used an open source javascript plugin called Highcharts for graphing the temperature data.
